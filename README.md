A Flutter package for obtaining better feedback. It allows the user to provide interactive feedback 
directly in the app, by annotating a screenshot of the current page, as well as by adding text.
Get it on [pub.dev/packages/feedback](https://pub.dev/packages/feedback)!

## Motivation

It is often quite hard to understand user issues with an app.
This package aims to support the developer by making it easier for the user 
to provide good and helpful feedback. 
Thus this library tries to be pretty easy to use by the user and 
lightweight to integrate for the developer.

## Setup

First, you will need to add `feedback` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  feedback: x.y.z # use the latest version found on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` in your terminal.

## Getting Started

Just wrap your app in a `BetterFeedback` widget.
To show the feedback view just call `BetterFeedback.of(context).show(...);`.
The callback gets called when the user submits his feedback. 

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:feedback/feedback.dart';
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    BetterFeedback(
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Provide a way to show the feedback panel by calling `BetterFeedback.of(context).show(...);`
Provide a way to hide the feedback panel by calling  `BetterFeedback.of(context).hide();` 

### Upload feedback

To upload the feedback you should use, for example, a [MultipartRequest](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/MultipartRequest-class.html).

### Configuration

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:feedback/feedback.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  void main() {
    runApp(
      BetterFeedback(
        child: const MyApp(),
        theme: FeedbackThemeData(
          // You can customize the background color, ...
          background: Colors.grey,
          // ... the color of the bottomsheet, ...
          feedbackSheetColor: Colors.grey[50],
          // ... the colors with which the user can draw...
          drawColors: [
            Colors.red,
            Colors.green,
            Colors.blue,
            Colors.yellow,
          ],
        ),
        // ... and the language used by BetterFeedback.
        localizationsDelegates: const [
          DefaultMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
          DefaultCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
          DefaultWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
          GlobalFeedbackLocalizationsDelegate(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
How the properties of `FeedbackThemeData` correspond to the view can be seen in the following image.

## Tips, tricks and usage scenarios

- You can combine this with [device_info](https://pub.dev/packages/device_info)
and [package_info](https://pub.dev/packages/package_info) to 
get additional information about the users environment to better understand
his feedback and debug his issues. 
- You can record the users navigation with a [NavigatorObserver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NavigatorObserver-class.html) and send it as an addition to the 
feedback of the user. This way you know how the user got to the location shown
in the screenshot.
- Use it as a view for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)s [user feedback](https://docs.sentry.io/enriching-error-data/user-feedback/?platform=browser) to collect additional user 
information upon hitting an error.

## Known Issues and limitations

- Platform views are invisible in screenshots (like [webview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) or [Google Maps](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter))
- Why does the content of my Scaffold change (gets repositioned upwards) while I'm
    writing my feedback?
    - Probably because Scaffold.[resizeToAvoidBottomInset](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold/resizeToAvoidBottomInset.html) 
      is set to true. You could set it to false while the user provides feedback.
